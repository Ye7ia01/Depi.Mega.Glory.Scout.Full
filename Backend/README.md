## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-organization]/GloryScout.git

   ```

2. Restore dependencies:
   ```bash

   ```

4. Access the application:
   - API: Running on https://localhost:8080 and http://localhost:8081
   - Swagger UI: https://localhost:8081/swagger

Note: The application uses SQL Server with the connection string configured in `GloryScout.API/appsettings.json`. If you need to modify the database connection, update this file before running the application.

   ```

### Docker Deployment

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t gloryscout -f GloryScout.API/Dockerfile .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 gloryscout
